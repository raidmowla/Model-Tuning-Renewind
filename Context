Renewable energy sources play an increasingly important role in the global energy mix, as the effort to reduce the environmental impact of energy production increases.
Out of all the renewable energy alternatives, wind energy is one of the most developed technologies worldwide. 
The U.S. Department of Energy has put together a guide to achieving operational efficiency using predictive maintenance practices. Predictive maintenance uses sensor information and analysis methods to measure and predict degradation and future component capability. The idea behind predictive maintenance is that failure patterns are predictable and if component failure can be predicted accurately and the component is replaced before it fails, the costs of operation and maintenance will be much lower. The sensors fitted across different machines involved in the process of energy generation collect data related to various environmental factors (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) and additional features related to various parts of the wind turbine (gearbox, tower, blades, break, etc.). Data has 40 predictors, 20000 observations in the training set and 5000 in the test set.
